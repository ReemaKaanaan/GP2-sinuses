This dataset shows sinuses conditions through a criterion that processes ROIs for each sinus and the label that state the health of the sinuse, in addition to the 5 sinuses conditions and labels, in this dataset there are also other segments that affect the health of patients and lead to immediate surgery, for these segments the dataset includes other features that are calculated through a criterion that processes ROIs for each segment and a label for each one of them that state the health of it as follows:
